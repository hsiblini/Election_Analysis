## Election Audit Summary
 There is a statement to the election commission that explores how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script. (4 pt)
This script can be run to include any election data provided in CSV format. One way to modify the script can be to look for specific "key words" as the headers, and start searching for data underneath each header. Another way could be to present data in tabular form in the text file, or perhaps printing to a word document file (.doc) or even another excel file.
